## Introduction

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing customer data stored in a CSV file. The script performs various calculations and data manipulations to derive insights from the customer data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas library

Install the required library using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas

## CSV File Format

The CSV file should have the following columns:

- `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `name`: Customer's full name.
- `age`: Customer's age.
- `location`: Customer's city or region.
- `purchase_history`: Semi-colon separated list of items purchased with their respective prices (item name and price).

Ensure that the CSV file follows this format for the script to work correctly.
